# wunderdog-puzzles

Wunderdog company create "wundernuts" which are nice little puzzles for all programmers.
 
It's possible to use any language which makes solving these puzzles very interesting.
(It would be fun to see other solutions written with totally different languages!)

All wundernuts are listed here: https://wunder.dog/wundernuts.

I have solved two of those with Kotlin language which seems to be very slick, powerfull and easy to read language.
(Atleast for a programmer coming from Java land.)

My ambition or goal is to crack puzzles using different languages. My last effort was to use Erland for solving 
shortest-edition puzzle but Erlang's core library do not provide API for manupulating strings 
so I decided to go one more time with Kotlin.
